# WordEgo

This is a simple Word game i developed using Android Studio & Kotlin with a MVVM Artichecture.
I also used Navigation Component so navigating from 1 activity/Fragment to another becomes easier 

In this App the UI is divided into 4 parts leaving the Splash screen aside :

1) The main home where the user can start the game
2) The play UI where all the game realated activites are being held
3) A TryAgain UI 
4) A Winner UI

# How the Game Works :-

The WordEgo App will generate random Scrammble Words and the user have to guess the words . The User have to 
guess 10 words right so that he can win .The user will have only 20 chances and if the user can guess all the words 
correctly in 20 chances then he will win if not the user will lose the game.

Thankyou
